# Full-Stack Application

This is a full-stack web application with **Frontend** built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and **Backend** built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). The frontend communicates with the backend to fetch data and provide the user interface.

## Project Overview

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using **Next.js**, which is a React-based framework. It serves the user-facing part of the application and interacts with the backend to fetch and display data.
- **Backend**: The backend is built with **Node.js** and provides API endpoints that the frontend can call for data, authentication, and other operations.

## Getting Started Locally

Follow the steps below to set up both the frontend and backend on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://npmjs.com) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Setting Up the Frontend (Next.js)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrashantD1612/Website-App.git
